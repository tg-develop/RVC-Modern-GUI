## Overview

This is a modern, redesigned web client for the Voice Changer application that replaces the original client interface with a contemporary, user-friendly design. The modern GUI provides the same functionality as the original client while offering improved user experience, better accessibility, and enhanced visual design.

## Features

- **Modern Design**: Clean, intuitive interface built with modern web technologies
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for different screen sizes and devices
- **Real-time Controls**: Live audio controls with visual feedback
- **Model Management**: Easy model slot management with drag-and-drop support
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance statistics and audio visualizations
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Switchable theme support for user preference
- **Modal System**: Organized modal dialogs for settings and advanced features
- **Accessibility**: Improved keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Releases

Download the latest compiled release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tg-develop/RVC-Modern-GUI/releases/tag/release) to get pre-built files ready for installation.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> **Prerequisites**: Before installing this modern GUI client, ensure you have the [Voice Changer by deiteris](https://github.com/deiteris/voice-changer) installed and working properly. This GUI client is a frontend replacement and requires the Voice Changer backend to function.

To use the modern GUI client as a replacement for the original interface:

1. **Download the latest release:**
   
   Download the compiled release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tg-develop/RVC-Modern-GUI/releases/tag/release) and extract the files.

2. **Replace the original client files:**
   
   Navigate to your Voice Changer installation directory and backup the original client:
   ```bash
   # Backup original client (optional)
   mv client/demo/dist client/demo/dist_backup
   
   # Copy modern GUI files to replace original client
   cp -r path/to/extracted/dist client/demo/dist
   ```

3. **Start the Voice Changer server as usual:**
   
   The modern GUI will now be served instead of the original client when you access the Voice Changer web interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The modern GUI client is designed to work with the existing Voice Changer backend. No server-side changes are required.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **[Voice Changer by deiteris](https://github.com/deiteris/voice-changer)** - Base application (required)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.0.0 or later)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, or Edge 90+

> [!NOTE]
> For development, you need the [Voice Changer backend server](https://github.com/deiteris/voice-changer) running on `http://localhost:18888`.

### Setting up the development environment

1. Navigate to the modern-gui directory:
   ```bash
   cd client/modern-gui
   ```

2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the Voice Changer server to serve the modern GUI:
   
   In your Voice Changer server's `const.py` file, update the `FRONTEND_DIR` path to point to the modern-gui dist directory:
   ```python
   FRONTEND_DIR = "client/modern-gui/dist"
   ```

4. Build the development version:
   ```bash
   npm run build:dev
   ```

5. Start the Voice Changer server as usual

The modern GUI will now be served through the Voice Changer's web server. Rebuild with `npm run build:dev` whenever you make changes to see them reflected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Voice Changer backend server must be running and configured to serve from the modern-gui dist directory.

### Available scripts

**Development:**
- `npm run start` - Starts the Webpack development server with hot reloading

**Build Scripts:**
- `npm run clean` - Removes the dist directory
- `npm run webpack:prod` - **Webpack only** - Runs Webpack with production configuration (no cleanup)
- `npm run webpack:dev` - **Webpack only** - Runs Webpack with development configuration (no cleanup)
- `npm run build:prod` - **Complete production build** - Cleans dist directory + runs webpack:prod
- `npm run build:dev` - **Complete development build** - Cleans dist directory + runs webpack:dev

**Library Modifications:**
- `npm run build:mod` - Builds and copies middleware library modifications (lib directory)
- `npm run build:mod_dos` - Windows version of build:mod
- `npm run build:mod_copy` - Copies library modifications to node_modules (Windows only)

### Building for production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This will create a `dist` folder with optimized static files ready for deployment.
